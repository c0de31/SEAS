            The Subnational Economic Accounts System (SEAS) is an initiative of the PSA through the
            Subnational Economic Accounts Division (SEAD) to have a centralized system for the annual
            compilation of the Regional Accounts of the Philippines (RAP) and the Provincial Product Accounts (PPA).
            This system covers coordination to stakeholders, submission of collected data, data validation, 
            data processing, data management, data monitoring and visualization, estimation, and data consolidation.
